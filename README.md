The twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates"><i>WeRateDogs</i></a> comments on dogs' images and gives rating scores. 
We briefly review our insights into its preprocessed dataset that includes about 1600 tweets combined as well as the dog breed predictions. 
Most tweets (>98%) were submited via iPhone users whereas 1.3% were sent via online version and only 0.5% from Twitter Deck.
